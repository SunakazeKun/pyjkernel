# pyjkernel
**pyjkernel** is a high-level implementation of Nintendo's homemade ResourceArchive (RARC) as well as SZS and SZP compression formats. As of now, it's still work in progress.

## Setup
This library requires **Python 3.6 or newer** as well as [oead](https://github.com/zeldamods/oead). The latter will be installed automatically. You can use pip to install *pyjkernel*:
```sh
pip install pyjkernel
```
